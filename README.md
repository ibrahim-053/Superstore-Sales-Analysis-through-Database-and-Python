# Superstore-Sales-Analysis-through-Database-and-Python

This project is a part of Databanken course of Master of Computational Social System in TU Graz.
We have collected the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final?select=Sample+-+Superstore.csv , but we donâ€™t know the original source of the dataset.
The main objective of the project is to find out the location impact on sales on profit; Segment, Category and Sub-Categories impact on sales and profit. 
Before making the analysis, we have split the dataset and prepared Enterprise Relationship Diagram and then ingested data in PostgreSQL. After ingesting data, we have we used SQL queries to find out objective and then we use Python to generate the plots to visualize the findings.

Anyone can use the dataset, SQL queries, Python codes to reproduce the result and do other analysis.
